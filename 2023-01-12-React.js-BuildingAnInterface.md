## Set Up and Install

### Installing Requirements

- git (and git bash which let you use linux commands on a PC)
- Node.js
  - npm with 5.2 or higher
- React Developer Tools (Chrome Extension)
- React Snippets (VSC plugin)
- JS/JSX Snippets (VSC plugin)

  - "editor.snippetSuggestions": "top",

- CREATE REACT APP

  ```npm
  npx create-react-app (name)
  cd (name)
  npm start
  ```

### React Installation

- Modules installed with a React app

  - WebPack
    - JavaScript Bundler, manages how our application is assembled
  - Babel
    - JavaScript Compiler
  - ES Lint
    - Code Analizer against rules
  - Jest
    - Testing framework
  - Web Vitals
    - Performance monitoring tool

- Folder structure

  - Public folder
    - files that WebPack will manage
    - files to be moved to the server when it is deployed
    - index.html (most important section id="root" where the application will be loaded)
  - src folder

    - index.js

      - is the entry point for the JavaScript application
      - import code from different libraries
      - like React and React-dom
      - these libraries are loaded by Node.js using the dependencies listed in the package.json file
      - we are using the react library inside the render command using the Strict Mode during development
      - Strict mode will complain during development if potentially dangerous code is inserted

        ```js
        root.render(
          <React.StrictMode>
            <App />
          </React.StrictMode>,
        );
        ```

    - App.js
    - App.test.js
      - some jest code

- Although the code follows what looks to be JavaScript, it's written in a language called JSX, which is a combination of JavaScript and HTML

  - Whenever we use the keyword class in HTML, we need to use className in JSX

- REGARDING JSX (taken from [webTips for JSX](https://www.webtips.dev/javascript-vs-jsx#:~:text=JavaScript%20is%20a%20programming%20language,right%20inside%20your%20JavaScript%20file.))
  - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that stands for JavaScript XML.
  - React can be written with, or without JSX. Although it is highly recommended to go with JSX for your own sanity.
  - JSX supports the use of expressions by using curly braces.
  - Attributes in JSX are written in camelCase.
  - JSX elements must always be closed. If there are no children elements involved, then elements must be self-closing.
  - Only one JSX can be returned at a time. Use fragments if you need to return multiple elements.
  - Functions can return JSX elements.
  - JSX is generated to React.createElement function calls.

### Customizing your installs

- deleting files

  - public
    - logos
    - manifest.json
    - robots.txt
  - src
    - app.css
    - app.test.js
    - logo.svg
    - reportvitals
    - setuptest

- modifying files
  - index.html
    - delete comments
    - delete tags like icon, description, apple-touch-icon, manifest
  - index.js
    - delete webvitals
    - delete comments
  - App.js
    - delete imports logo, css file
    - delete the entire header
    - you can add an h1 to see something

### Using React icon components

- Using React Icons

```npm
npm install react-icons --save
```

- documentation [React Icons Docuemntation](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- it will only insert the code for the icon that you need

  ```
  import { ICONNAME } from "react-icons/LIBNAME";
  ...
  <iconname></iconname>
  ```

- the first two letters are the extension

```js
import { GiGlassHeart } from "react-icons/gi";
<GiGlassHeart />;
```

### Installing TailWind CSS in React

- It is a framework, with a utility first approach
- the command is installing additional components to make it compatible

  ```npm
  npm install -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9 @tailwindcss/forms
  ```

- Because current React version does not support PostCSS 8, we need to install Craco (Create react App Configuration Override)

  ```npm
  npm install @craco/craco
  ```

- and then replace the scripts with this to use Craco

  ```json
  "start": "craco start",
  "build": "craco build",
  "test": "craco test",
  ```

- Add file craco.config.js

  ```js
  // craco.config.js
  module.exports = {
    style: {
      postcss: {
        plugins: [require("tailwindcss"), require("autoprefixer")],
      },
    },
  };
  ```

- Setting TailWind config, this command creates the file tailwind.config.js

  ```npm
  npx tailwindcss init
  ```

- Within that file tailwind.config.js insert these lines to make the output smaller (Difference between tailwind and something like bootstrap that insert a lot of classes that yo dont need)

  ```js
  purge: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/index.html'],
  ...
  plugins: [ require('@tailwindcss/forms')]
  ```

- Modifying our CSS

  - tailwind needs to import its subcomponents
  - replace everything within index.css with these lines:

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

- Modifying our jsx

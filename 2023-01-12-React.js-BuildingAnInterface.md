## 1. Set Up and Install

### Installing Requirements

- git (and git bash which let you use linux commands on a PC)
- Node.js
  - npm with 5.2 or higher
- React Developer Tools (Chrome Extension)
- React Snippets (VSC plugin)
- JS/JSX Snippets (VSC plugin)

  - "editor.snippetSuggestions": "top",

- CREATE REACT APP

  ```npm
  npx create-react-app (name)
  cd (name)
  npm start
  ```

### React Installation

- Modules installed with a React app

  - WebPack
    - JavaScript Bundler, manages how our application is assembled
  - Babel
    - JavaScript Compiler
  - ES Lint
    - Code Analizer against rules
  - Jest
    - Testing framework
  - Web Vitals
    - Performance monitoring tool

- Folder structure

  - Public folder
    - files that WebPack will manage
    - files to be moved to the server when it is deployed
    - index.html (most important section id="root" where the application will be loaded)
  - src folder

    - index.js

      - is the entry point for the JavaScript application
      - import code from different libraries
      - like React and React-dom
      - these libraries are loaded by Node.js using the dependencies listed in the package.json file
      - we are using the react library inside the render command using the Strict Mode during development
      - Strict mode will complain during development if potentially dangerous code is inserted

        ```js
        root.render(
          <React.StrictMode>
            <App />
          </React.StrictMode>,
        );
        ```

    - App.js
    - App.test.js
      - some jest code

- Although the code follows what looks to be JavaScript, it's written in a language called JSX, which is a combination of JavaScript and HTML

  - Whenever we use the keyword class in HTML, we need to use className in JSX

- REGARDING JSX (taken from [webTips for JSX](https://www.webtips.dev/javascript-vs-jsx#:~:text=JavaScript%20is%20a%20programming%20language,right%20inside%20your%20JavaScript%20file.))
  - JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that stands for JavaScript XML.
  - React can be written with, or without JSX. Although it is highly recommended to go with JSX for your own sanity.
  - JSX supports the use of expressions by using curly braces.
  - Attributes in JSX are written in camelCase.
  - JSX elements must always be closed. If there are no children elements involved, then elements must be self-closing.
  - Only one JSX can be returned at a time. Use fragments if you need to return multiple elements.
  - Functions can return JSX elements.
  - JSX is generated to React.createElement function calls.

### Customizing your installs

- deleting files

  - public
    - logos
    - manifest.json
    - robots.txt
  - src
    - app.css
    - app.test.js
    - logo.svg
    - reportvitals
    - setuptest

- modifying files
  - index.html
    - delete comments
    - delete tags like icon, description, apple-touch-icon, manifest
  - index.js
    - delete webvitals
    - delete comments
  - App.js
    - delete imports logo, css file
    - delete the entire header
    - you can add an h1 to see something

### Using React icon components

- Using React Icons

```npm
npm install react-icons --save
```

- documentation [React Icons Docuemntation](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
- it will only insert the code for the icon that you need

- In App.js

  ```
  import { ICONNAME } from "react-icons/LIBNAME";
  ...
  <iconname></iconname>
  ```

- the first two letters are the extension

```js
import { GiGlassHeart } from "react-icons/gi";
<GiGlassHeart />;
```

### Installing TailWind CSS in React

- It is a framework, with a utility first approach
- the command is installing additional components to make it compatible

  ```npm
  npm install -D tailwindcss@npm:@tailwindcss/postcss7-compat @tailwindcss/postcss7-compat postcss@^7 autoprefixer@^9 @tailwindcss/forms
  ```

- Because current React version does not support PostCSS 8, we need to install Craco (Create react App Configuration Override)

  ```npm
  npm install @craco/craco
  ```

- and then replace the scripts with this to use Craco

  ```json
  "start": "craco start",
  "build": "craco build",
  "test": "craco test",
  ```

- Add file craco.config.js

  ```js
  // craco.config.js
  module.exports = {
    style: {
      postcss: {
        plugins: [require("tailwindcss"), require("autoprefixer")],
      },
    },
  };
  ```

- Setting TailWind config, this command creates the file tailwind.config.js

  ```npm
  npx tailwindcss init
  ```

- Within that file tailwind.config.js insert these lines to make the output smaller (Difference between tailwind and something like bootstrap that insert a lot of classes that yo dont need)

  ```js
  purge: ['./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}', './public/index.html'],
  ...
  plugins: [ require('@tailwindcss/forms')]
  ```

- Modifying our CSS

  - tailwind needs to import its subcomponents
  - replace everything within index.css with these lines:

    ```css
    @tailwind base;
    @tailwind components;
    @tailwind utilities;
    ```

- Modifying our jsx
  -adding some Tailwind classes to test it
  ```js
  function App() {
    return (
      <div className="App container mx-auto mt-3 font-thin">
        <h1 className="text-5xl">
          <BsHeart className="inline-block text-red-400 align-top" /> My React
          Interface <BsHeart className="inline-block text-red-400 align-top" />
        </h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
  ```

---

- The way explained in the training didn't work, trying the step by step in [tailwind instructions](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app)

- Linkedin Comment

  - No need for Craco: For anyone reading this as of March 2022 I successfully installed Tailwinds 3.0.23 with postcss 8.4.12 using the Tailwinds install npm install -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer. I needed to use this in the index.css: @import "tailwindcss/base"; @import "tailwindcss/components"; @import "tailwindcss/utilities";

- ... And then installing forms

  ```npm
  npm install -D tailwindcss @tailwindcss/forms
  ```

- finally I applied the plugins line (tailwind.config.js)
  ```js
  plugins: [ require('@tailwindcss/forms')],
  ```

## 2. Getting Started

### Your first component

- index.js does not start outputting HTML content in the page, instead it call the App component
- components folder within src
- ussually components first letter is capitalized
- ways to create a component
  - function
  - arrow function
- JavaScript function that returns some HTML like stuff which is what we call JSX

### Creating a sub-component Hooks

- In this case the instructor considered to keep the two components in one file, to keep together things that belong together and not put everything in a separate file, so, it is an option.

### Getting appointments and debugging

### Importing JSON data as a variable

```js
import appointmentList from "./data.json";
```

-within the App function (App.js) an ul with map method

```js
<ul className="divide-y divide-gray-200">
  {appointmentList.map((appointment) => (
    <li className="px-3 py-3 flex items-start">
      <button
        type="button"
        className="p-1.5 mr-1.5 mt-1 rounded text-white bg-red-500 hover:bg-yellow-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-blue-500"
      >
        <BiTrash />
      </button>
      <div className="flex-grow">
        <div className="flex items-center">
          <span className="flex-none font-medium text-2xl text-blue-500">
            {appointment.petName}
          </span>
          <span className="flex-grow text-right">{appointment.aptDate}</span>
        </div>
        <div>
          <b className="font-bold text-blue-500">Owner:</b>{" "}
          {appointment.ownerName}
        </div>
        <div className="leading-tight">{appointment.aptNotes}</div>
      </div>
    </li>
  ))}
</ul>
```

---

## 3. Sort and Search

### Passing data to a component

- Every time you use a loop through a series of elements, you should use the key
- basically moving the config from app.js to a component, passing the variable as {appointment}

### the UseState Hook and conditional classes

- Hooks allow you to use state and other react features without having to write classes
- first import useState from React

  ```js
  import { useState } from "react";
  ```

- the create the variable and the function to modify it (ussually the same name with the prefix set), and initialize with some value.

  ```js
  let [toggleForm, setToggleForm] = useState(false);
  ```

- then, the JSX code we want to depend from the status of the variable is set after evaluating the variable state

  ```js
    {
      toggleForm &&
        <div className=
        ...
    }
  ```

- And we can use the variable to modify certain classes using JS expressions like follows:

  ```js
  <button
    onClick={() => {
      setToggleForm(!toggleForm);
    }}
    className={`bg-blue-400 text-white px-2 py-3 w-full text-left
    ${toggleForm ? "rounded-t-md" : "rounded-md"}`}
  >
    <div>
      <BiCalendarPlus className="inline-block align-text-top" /> Add Appointment
    </div>
  </button>
  ```

### Passing state and hiding components

- return null if you dont want to show the component, and return the regular component if you do

  ```js
  if (!toggle) {
    return null;
  }
  ```

- it is not just hiding it, it just doesn't exist when the toggle is false

  ```js
  <div>
    <button
      type="button"
      onClick={() => {
        setToggleSort(!toggleSort);
      }}
      className="justify-center px-4 py-2 bg-blue-400 border-2 border-blue-400 text-sm text-white hover:bg-blue-700 focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 flex items-center"
      id="options-menu"
      aria-haspopup="true"
      aria-expanded="true"
    >
      Sort By <BiCaretDown className="ml-2" />
    </button>
    <DropDown toggle={toggleSort} />
  </div>
  ```

---

## 4. Mutating Data

### useEffect and useCallback Hooks

- useEffect lets you use what are called side-effects and function components
- perfect for data searching operations and manually changing the DOM when certain components are a result of these operations
- anything in the public folder will appear at the same level as your application once it has been pushed up to a server.
- with this code portion, if the data changes for some reason, useEffect will keep track of it, and update our application automatically

### Deleting Records

- sometimes you create things that live within the different components. The parent component didnt need to know about toggling something on and off inside a component. In this case the parent needs to know because we are going to be changing the data itself, and the parent component is going to manage all that data.
- within App function in App.js it is created the onDeleteAppointment function
  ```js
  <ul className="divide-y divide-gray-200">
    {appointmentList.map((appointment) => (
      <AppointmentInfo
        key={appointment.id}
        appointment={appointment}
        onDeleteAppointment={(appointmentId) =>
          setAppointmentList(
            appointmentList.filter(
              (appointment) => appointment.id !== appointmentId,
            ),
          )
        }
      />
    ))}
  </ul>
  ```

### Searching with a filtered Array

- Two way communication between the Search module and the parent component, with the onChange event and passing the target.value

  ```js
  <input
    type="text"
    name="query"
    id="query"
    value={query}
    onChange={(event) => {
      onQueryChange(event.target.value);
    }}
    className="pl-8 rounded-md focus:ring-indigo-500 focus:border-indigo-500 block w-full sm:text-sm border-gray-300"
    placeholder="Search"
  />
  ```

  -So, now the Search component passes this

  ```js
  const Search = ({ query, onQueryChange }) => {
  ```

- Then, in the App Component (Parent), it is defined a new variable with useState

  ```js
  let [query, setQuery] = useState("");
  ```

- Then, we need to modify the way when Search is called, it handles the info using the hook

  ```js
  <Search query={query} onQueryChange={(myQuery) => setQuery(myQuery)} />
  ```

- for changing what is shown we dont want to change the original Array, but to keep and have a separate new Array with the Query results.

  ```js
  const filteredAppointments = appointmentList.filter((item) => {
    return (
      item.petName.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()) ||
      item.ownerName.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase()) ||
      item.aptNotes.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
    );
  });
  ```

- Finally, when rendering the content instead of using the original appointmentList, we use the new const filteredAppointments
  ```js
  <ul className="divide-y divide-gray-200">
        {filteredAppointments
  ```

### Setting up sort

- two additonal states, sortBy initialize by "petName", and orderBy initialize by "asc" (Ascending Order)

  ```js
  let [sortBy, setSortBy] = useState("petName");
  let [orderBy, setOrderBy] = useState("asc");
  ```

- We add the sort method to the const filteredAppointments
  ```js
  const filteredAppointments = appointmentList
    .filter
    //Previous Internal Code
    ()
    .sort((a, b) => {
      let order = orderBy === "asc" ? 1 : -1;
      return a[sortBy].toLowerCase() < b[sortBy].toLowerCase()
        ? -1 * order
        : 1 * order;
    });
  ```

### Programmning the sorting interface

- in App.js, within the callinto Search component, we pass some additional info

  ```js
  <Search
    query={query}
    onQueryChange={(myQuery) => setQuery(myQuery)}
    orderBy={orderBy}
    onOrderByChange={(mySort) => setOrderBy(mySort)}
    sortBy={sortBy}
    onSortByChange={(mySort) => setSortBy(mySort)}
  />
  ```

- in the Search component itself, we need to add those variables (of course), and then passing them down to the DropDown component

  ```js
  const Search = ({ query, onQueryChange, sortBy, onSortByChange, orderBy, onOrderByChange }) => {
  ```

  ```js
  <DropDown
    toggle={toggleSort}
    orderBy={orderBy}
    onOrderByChange={(mySort) => onOrderByChange(mySort)}
    sortBy={sortBy}
    onSortByChange={(mySort) => onSortByChange(mySort)}
  />
  ```

- Then, the DropDown of course needs to receive as well those variables

  ```js
  const DropDown = ({toggle, orderBy, onOrderByChange, sortBy, onSortByChange }) => {
  ```

- Let's define the onClick events for each of de divs

  ```js
    <div onClick={() => onSortByChange('petName')}
  ```

  ```js
    <div onClick={() => onSortByChange('ownerName')}
  ```

  ```js
    <div onClick={() => onSortByChange('aptDate')}
  ```

  ```js
    <div onClick={() => onOrderByChange('asc')}
  ```

  ```js
    <div onClick={() => onOrderByChange('desc')}
  ```

- and add the ternary conditions to show the chekc mark when the respective criteria or order is selected

  ```js
  role="menuitem">Pet Name {(sortBy === 'petName') && <BiCheck />}</div>
  ```

  ```js
  role="menuitem">Owner Name  {(sortBy === 'ownerName') && <BiCheck />}</div>
  ```

  ```js
  role="menuitem">Date {(sortBy === 'aptDate') && <BiCheck />}</div>
  ```

  ```js
  role="menuitem">Asc {(orderBy === 'asc') && <BiCheck />}</div>
  ```

  ```js
  role="menuitem">Desc {(orderBy === 'desc') && <BiCheck />}</div>
  ```
